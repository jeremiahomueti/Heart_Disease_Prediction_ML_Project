# Heart Disease Prediction Classification Model
A Logistic Regression model for heart disease risk classification (Accuracy: ≈ 80%). Includes data analysis, training, and evaluation. Full technical guide available on Medium: https://medium.com/@jeremiahomueti/build-your-first-machine-learning-model-step-by-step-no-experience-needed-090545175d9b

## 1. Overview and Objective

This project documents the development and evaluation of a supervised machine learning model designed to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. The goal is to perform a **binary classification** (0 = no disease, 1 = disease) using clinical data.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow, including data analysis, preparation, model training, and performance evaluation.

## 2. Technical Article and Documentation

A comprehensive, step-by-step technical article detailing the development process, conceptual explanations (e.g., train-test split, supervised learning), and code walkthrough is available on Medium.

## 3. Methodology and Algorithms

* **Learning Type:** Supervised Learning.
* **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression, chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
* **Data Split:** The dataset was partitioned into a training set and a testing set using an **80% / 20% split**.

## 4. Key Performance Results

The model's performance was evaluated using the unseen test set (20% of the data).

* **Final Accuracy Score:** Approximately **80%**.

## 5. Required Libraries

This project was developed in a Jupyter Notebook using the Python programming language. The following libraries were used and are required to run the notebook:

* **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`, `numpy`.
* **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
* **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` (for data splitting, model training, and evaluation).
